# FFmpeg Examples

Trying to learn FFmpeg was almost impossible for me when I was attempting use it. The examples were all over the internet, but I had spent so much time wrestling with outdated codes: deprecated functions and really, really sparse documentation. I don't think I have understood much of it yet, but I had taken a long time to piece enough together to do some useful stuff. 

+1 to those wonderful people on StackOverflow and irc.lc/freenode/ffmpeg who helped me along the way and keeping my sanity hanging on the edge of the cliff. Now, I would like to give back to the community. So here it is: my attempt to add just another piece of example to the heap of examples already found on the internet. The examples here are based on FFmpeg 3.1 and to the best of my knowledge works as intended. (Having said that, the best of my knowledge isn't the best of knowledge.)

Do what you will with it, but I would really appreciate it that you could contribute back to this repository also. Cheers.
