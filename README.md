# FFmpeg Examples

Trying to learn FFmpeg was almost impossible for me when I was attempting use it. The examples were all over the internet, but I had spent so much time wrestling with outdated codes: deprecated functions and really, really sparse documentation. I don't think I have understood much of it yet, but I had taken a long time to piece enough together to do some useful stuff. 

+1 to those wonderful people on StackOverflow and irc.lc/freenode/ffmpeg who helped me along the way and keeping my sanity hanging on the edge of the cliff. Now, I would like to give back to the community. So here it is: my attempt to add just another piece of example to the heap of examples already found on the internet. Do what you will with it, but I would really appreciate it that you could contribute back to this repository also. Cheers.


List of examples:
